Created by Tami and Annie, during a BrainStation hackathon, Plant Checker is an app to help you determine whether your plants need to come inside based on current weather conditions.
          
Our goal is to make plant care easier and more intuitive, ensuring your green friends stay healthy and happy. This app was born out of a BrainStation hackathon challenge, where we had just 5 hours to bring our idea to life.

Through teamwork, creativity, and a dash of code magic, we developed a tool to simplify plant care decisions. Thank you for using our app, and happy gardening!
